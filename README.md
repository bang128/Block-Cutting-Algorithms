# COMP257-Final-Project

## Description

## Python files
- The 1st file include 3 functions for the 3 algorithms: Brute Force, Greedy and Dynamic Programming.
- The 2nd .py file include 2 functions. 
   - The test function takes an input file as its argument (the input file contains the total weight of the given gold block, and a list of weights and corresponding costs). This function is to test the 3 algorithms with each test case. 
   - The main function is to run the test function with 5 test cases

## Text files
- There are 5 .txt files that contains all information for the 5 test cases. The test function will take each of these .txt files as the argument.
