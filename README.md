# COMP257-Final-Project

## Description

## Python files
- algorithms.py include 3 functions for the 3 algorithms: Brute Force, Greedy and Dynamic Programming. These 3 functions take 2 arguments
   - block_weight: the total weight of the given gold block
   - weight_cost: a dictionary in which keys are weights and values are the corresponding costs (missing weights cost 0).
- main_test.py file include 2 functions. 
   - The test function takes an input file as its argument (the input file contains the total weight of the given gold block, and a list of weights and corresponding costs). This function is to test the 3 algorithms with each test case. 
   - The main function is to run the test function with 5 test cases.

## Text files
- There are 5 .txt files that contains all information for the 5 test cases. The test function will take each of these .txt files as the argument.

## How to run
`python3 main_test.py`
